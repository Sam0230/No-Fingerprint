## What is a browser fingerprint
Browser can be identified by its screen resolution, color depth, installed plugins, supported mime types, timezone offset, etc., and each of most devices has its own audio and graphical rendering characteristic. These values are passed through a hashing function to produce a fingerprint that can identify a browser, or even a device. This is a big invasion of privacy.
## What does this userscript / extension do
It adds random noise to render results and stop websites from reading data like screen resolution, color depth, installed plugins to eliminate browser fingerprints.
## How to use
Simply install a userscript manager, such as Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, open https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/421262-no-fingerprint, and install this script.
For Google Chrome users, you can enable Developer Mode and install this script as an unpacked browser extension.
