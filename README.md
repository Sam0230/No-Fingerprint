## What is a browser fingerprint
Browser can be identified by its screen resolution, color depth, installed plugins, supported mime types, timezone offset, etc., and each of most devices has its own audio and graphical rendering characteristic. These values are passed through a hashing function to produce a fingerprint that can identify a browser, or even a device. This is a big invasion of privacy.
## What does this script do
It adds random noise to render results and stop websites from reading data like screen resolution, color depth, installed plugins to eliminate browser fingerprints.
